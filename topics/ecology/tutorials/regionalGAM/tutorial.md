# Introduction
{:.no_toc}


This tutorial will show how to study species phenology through the computation of abundance index and trends. It will explain you how to use different [regionalGAM](https://github.com/RetoSchmucki/regionalGAM) tools on Galaxy-E allowing you to deal with datasets containing occurences informations for various species per site and per date through a couple of years.
After a certain numbers of steps, you will be able to extract single species data and study related phenology through the years. The goal of this exercise is to be able to create abundance trend over time and biodiversity indicators. You could for example try to predict the occurences of one specific species in a certain type of environnement using the prediction model of climate evolution. Based on charts that you will generate, you could try to explain the evolution of a species with environmental data (temperatures variations, modifications of the environmental conditions).
You will basically learn how to create a file on the basis of which you can create a visual material that can be quite easily understood and therefore be efficient for a large audience.

# Step 1: Pre-processing

The goal of the first step is to upload and prepare the file so that it will be usable for the *regional GAM* analysis (See [this warning](#inputdatawarning) for more information about the input file.
First of all, you will have to upload the files on Galaxy-E and then you might have to use some data handling tools to be able to use *regional GAM* tools.

> ❗ If the dataset you have uploaded is on CSV format, you can skip the following part and directly go to [the resampling section](#resampling).
>
> ❗ However, if you are dealing with a dataset on the RData format (the second of the links listed above), you will have to process this binary file to obtain an appropriate CSV dataset. To do so, you can use the following tools:
>   > * Search for the tool `RData binary file reader`with the following parameters:
>   >      * "Rdata binary file to explore": "dataset on RData" 
>   > * Search for the tool `RData parser` with the following parameters:

>   >      * "File with .Rdata content details": file of **`RData binary file reader`**
>   >      * "Select which attribute(s) you want to extract": select everything but "trend"
>   >      * ⚠️ Please note that the tool `RData parser` creates separated files, each of them containing one column. The file with the "TREND" header can be let aside as we don't need it for what will follow.
>   > * Search for the tool `Coller deux jeux de données l'un à côté de l'autre` to create a file comporting all the data     required with the following parameters:

>   >      * "et": output of **RData parser** with headed with "SITE"
>   >      * Repeat `Coller deux jeux de données l'un à côté de l'autre` as many times as there are separated files in order to create a final dataset with all the columns. First you must paste 2 columns together, then you must paste this last file with a third column and do this action again and again until your final file countains all the columns.

You decided to upload a dataset on RData format and therefore you had to use the tools `RData binary file reader` and `RData parser`. This last tool treats the file and allows you to open it on Galaxy-E but it creates as many files as there are columns (when RData object is composed from a unique data table). This is the reason why you had to carry out on a set of actions ending by the creation of one complete file.</li>

When the dataset contains many details, it lengthens the file processing time therefore it can be very useful to learn how to hide the informations you don't need. For example, the list of sites (look at the column with header `SITE)` of the dataset you are using is really long, and this seems to be related to a classification of each site into several sub-sites. Here, we will assume that your file doesn't really need to be as precise and we will remove inforamtion about these sub-sites. To create a new "down-sampled" file, you can follow these steps:   

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: hiding some informations
>    > 1. Use the `CSV to tabular` tool to first create a tabular file from your csv one (with only one species). This is a mandatory step as further tools are only working on tabular files!
>    > 2. Search for the tool `trouver et remplacer des patterns dans des colonnes` on the file on CSV with the following  parameters.
>    >    >  * Select the input file & the column with the SITE header.
>    >    >  * Click on`"insert checks"`
>    >    >  * "Trouver l'expression suivante": `"(\.[0-9]+)"` which specifies that you don't want the sub-sites (all suites of digits following a "." character) to be taken into account.
>    >    >  * "Remplacement": leave it empty.
>    >    > ### {% icon question %} Questions After having successfully deleted the sub-sites informations, can you look at the original dataset and this new one and say how many sites you had, and you have now? You will maybe need to use tools like `Compter le nombre d'occurrences de chaque enregistrement`

# Step 2: Selectionning one specific species and showing all the data corresponding to it

The second step of any Regional GAM data analysis is making sure to have one dataset of only one specific species that you will then be able to use. If you want to create a graph showing abundance evolution by years of several species, you will have to superimpose the graphs on one another. 

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: How many species are taken into account in this dataset
>
> As the dataset is quite big and countains heterogeneous informations, you want to know wether the data are about one species or more.
> 1. Search for the tool `compter le nombre d'occurence de chaque enrégistrement`with the following parameters.
> * "Compter les occurrences des valeurs présentes dans la(les) colonne(s)": `column 1`
> * "Délimité par": `tabulation`.
> * "Comment les résultats doivent t'ils être triés ?": `Avec la valeur la plus présente en premier`.
> 2. Inspect the file by clicking on the `eye` icon to check how many species are taken into account.
> > If there is only one species you can skip the following steps and go directly to the file datatype convertion step using the tool `tabular to CSV`
>
>    > ### Create a new file concerning only the data of one species
>    > 1. Copy the name of the species you are interested in from the CSV file (for example: "Pyronia tithonus").
>    > 2. Search for the tool`filtrer des données dur une colonne en utilisant des expressions simples`with the following   parameters.
>    > * En utilisant la condition suivante: `"c1=='habitat2'"` replacing 'habitat2' with the name of the species (for example: `"c1=='"Pyronia tithonus"'"`)  
>    > * Nombre de lignes d'en-tête à passer: `"1"`.
>    > * You can repeat this set of actions as much as necessary, changing only the name of the species taken into account.
>    > 3. Search for the tool `tabular to CSV` with the following parameters 
>    > * Select the file you've just created 
>    > * Separators: `","`.

 # Step 3: Displaying the occurence of the chosen species through the years
 
Now you have a file containing all the data on the species of interest. The main goal of this step is basically to create a material that can be used to generate charts. What you could also do, for example, would be to compare the evolution of various species through the years in the same site. You would have to superpose the different graphs on one another.
>

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Phenology

This step will allow you the show the phenology of a species and then to create charts representing it. In the second part, you will learn that it is possible to show the phenology of various species on a single chart allowing to compare them and analyse them more easily. 

> 1. Search for the tool `flight curve` with the following parameters: 
> * "Fichier de comptage": `output` from **flight curve**.
>
> 🔹 Based on the flight curve, you can create a line chart which shows the occurence of the species through the years on a very visual material

> ### Expected temporal trend

The expected temporal trend allows you to have an overview of the evolution of a species in a certain type of environment in the futur.

![Expected temporal trend](https://github.com/Claraurf/training-material/blob/ecology/topics/ecology/tutorials/regionalGAM/Images/Expected%20temporal%20trend.png "This shows the expected evolution of Ardea alba")

>    > * "Fichier tabulé, produit par l'outil ab_index": `output` from **abundance index**.
>    
> ⚠️ Please note that sometimes the expected temporal trend can't be done on dataset. If you want this action to work, the occurences on your dataset must lie between the month of April and the end of the month of September.

Note also that you will obtain two files resulting of the action above. The first will be the graph and the second will contains the values of "x".

> ### Linear regression 

The point of doing a linear regression is to determinate if the year has an influence on the abundance of a species. 

>    > 1. Look for the tool `linear regression` with the following parameters.

# Conclusions  

{:.no_toc}

In this tutorial, you have analyzed regional GAM data to extract useful informations in order to be able to show different tendencies of a chosen species. Therefore, you are now able to treat the dataset so that it shows only the data concerning one specific species of your choice. From there, you can show the occurrence of this species through the years first on a dataset and then on a visual chart. You have also learned how to represent on a single chart the occurences of various species. Afterwards, we have shown you how to create a dataset containing the informations on the abundance of a species per year and per site. Based on which you can henceforth visually represent the annual abundance trend on a chart. Thereafter, you have the possibility of showing the expected temporal trend, based on which you will be able to try predicting the future evolution a given species. The last part of this tutorial has shown you how to calculate the linear regression allowing you to determinate wether the year has an influence on the abundance of a species or not.
